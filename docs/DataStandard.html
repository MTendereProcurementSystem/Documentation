                        class="c14 c54">&nbsp;with extensions in areas that were not covered by it. OCDS is an open data standard for
                        publication of structured information on all stages of a contracting process. The Open Contracting Data
                        Standard is maintained using JSON Schema. The main sections and common objects used in the schema are
                        introduced in the getting started section. </span></p>
                <h3 class="c68 c79" id="h.1fob9te"><span class="c167 c84">OCDS structure</span></h3>
                <p class="c42"><span class="c14 c54">The OCDS provides a detailed specification of the fields and data structures to
                        use when publishing open data about contracting processes. The OCDS concept of a release can be broadly equated
                        to the concept of a &lsquo;notice&rsquo; UNCITRAL regulations. </span></p>
                <p class="c42"><span class="c14 c54">The core OCDS schema is designed to support global interoperability, and to
                        include a common core of data fields required by a wide range of use cases. The OCDS schema can be extended
                        with definitions for new data structures to meet the needs of particular publishers. &nbsp;</span></p>
                <p class="c42"><span class="c14 c54">A typical OCDS release consists of Package, Release and one or more Sections. This
                        documentation includes Package and Release within this Structure subheading. Sections, such as Tender, Award
                        and Contract are explained within the Sections sub-heading. Objects are explained within the Building Blocks
                        and Extensions Building Blocks.</span></p>
                <h3 class="c68 c79" id="h.3znysh7"><span class="c167 c84">Building blocks</span></h3>
                <p class="c42"><span class="c14 c54">Building blocks are OCDS data structures that are smaller than most sections and
                        are coherent blocks of data in their own right. It should be possible to read a building blocks data in
                        isolation and for it to make sense. Where blocks have other building blocks nested within them the
                        documentation shows how those are structured and then provides an example of the data that describes the
                        building blocks together. </span></p>
                <p class="c42"><span class="c14 c54">The majority of OCDS data is held within a release structure. One or more releases
                        can be published within a release package. Releases are made up of a number of sections, including the
                        following.</span></p>

These form the basis of a qualification submission that such parties must make to demonstrate their ability to implement the project. CA selects several candidates to be invited to the next stage. This stage relates specifically to the selection of competent tenderers, prior to the issue of invitations to tender with a main purpose to select those potential suppliers, whose qualifications and experience would minimise the risk of non-performance.</p>

                                <p>The pre-selection of participants of future stages usually the first active stage of multi-stage procedures (restricted tender or any other). Therefore, the core of data-model of the pre-selection stage is the <a class="c6" href="#h.17nz8yj">contractNotice</a>and described as Release Package.</p>
                                <p>Since the stage is active (meaning that there are user actions form CA and EOs expected) in its process there are data describing its course and result generated by Users Actions.

                                <p>During ‘Pre-qualification’ stage all invited (pre-selected) parties can also clarify any additional details of object of future procurement with CA and with respond to an invitation are submits a technical offer according to instructions or a questionnaire. These form the basis of a pre-qualification submission that such parties must make to demonstrate benefits and superiorities of theirs offers. CA selects several candidates to be invited to the next stage.</p>
                                <p>The pre-qualification process itself consists of the examination and evaluation of the technical part of received offers according to specifications and requirements as defined in the tender documentation, analyse their benefit and determine their superiority. Pre-qualification is the basis for the subsequent selection of the offer that provides the best value for money for the CA.</p>

                                <h3>Data Transfer Approach</h3>
                                <p>Data-releases must be published within a release package, which can contain one or more releases. The release package, modelled on the Data Package protocol, provides metadata about the release(s) it contains, the publisher, and data licensing information.</p>
                                <p>The following points describe some information about the releases and records:</p>
                                <ul><li>Releases are immutable, records are updated over the life of the contracting processes.</li>
                                <li>Releases are point in time updates, records show the most up to date information.</li>
                                <li>A single contracting process can have many releases but must have only one record.</li>
                                <li>Records either store a history of changes or links to individual releases.</li>
                                <li>The OCID remains consistent across all releases and records whilst the release ID changes with each release.</li>
                                <li>The value of persistent releases for spotting red flags.</li>
                                <li>Releases can repeat or update information from previous releases.</li>
                                <li>Release tags help to identify what stage of the contracting process a release is about</li>
                                </ul>
                                <h4 class="c85 c79" id="h.1ci93xb">Record Package</h4>
                                <p>The Record Package contains a list of records along with publishing metadata. The records pull together all the releases under a single OCID and compile them into the latest version of the information along with the history of any data changes.</p>

                                <h5 class="c38">Funding Source</h5><p>‘Funding Source’ is a model that describes a specific source of funding for needs from the parent ‘Expenditure Item’. Description contains information on both amount and the organization that provides the funds as well as other parties involved in the disposal of this funds: payer, donor. Also, through this model, the current status of the described budget is displayed, which makes it possible to understand whether the given budget is approved by the providing party (Treasury or Donor) and to what extent. The valence of the model enables the organisation of the relationships of the entities with other model entities (such as tenders and contracts). Thus, there is an opportunity to display the source of funds in announced tenders or concluded contracts.</p>

                                <p>Multi-stage process (MSP) is a model that describes a specific contract process - the procurement procedure announced by the CA. Depending on the type of procedure, method of procurement, geography and the legal basis, the attribute composition of the model can be adjusted, but its general logic remains unchanged for all types of procedures.</p>
                                <p>MSP described with a Record Package consists of four (at least) or more Release Packages:</p>

Depending on procurement method, the CN may be used either to award a contract (single-stage competition) or to pre-select participants for restricted competition (multi-stage competition). In this respect CN might be different from data-models’ perspective:</p>

This form the basis of a qualification submission that such parties must make to demonstrate their compliance to eligibility criteria and minimal technical requirements. CA selects several candidates to be invited to next stage. This stage relates specifically to the selection of competent participants, prior to the issue of the invitations to tender with a main purpose to select those potential suppliers, whose qualifications and experience would minimise the risk of non-performance.</p>
