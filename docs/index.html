                The eProcurement.Systems API is the only interface to Central Business
                Process Engine that is core unit of eProcurement.Systems infrastructure.
                The eProcurement.Systems API is a CQRS interface that provides programmatic
                access to BPE of the systems. It provides predictable URLs for accessing
                resources, and uses built-in HTTP features to receive commands and return
                responses. This makes it easy to communicate with.
            </p>
            <p dir="ltr">
                The API accepts JSON or form-encoded content in requests. It returns JSON
                content in all of its responses, including errors. Only the UTF-8 character
                encoding is supported for both requests and responses.

                In traditional architectures, the same data model is used to query and
                update a database. That's simple and works well for basic CRUD operations.
                In more complex applications, however, this approach can become unwieldy.
                For example, on the read side, the application may perform many different
                queries, returning data transfer objects (Data Transfer Objects or DTOs)
                with different shapes. Object mapping can become complicated. On the write
                side, the model may implement complex validation and business logic. As a
                result, you can end up with an overly complex model that does too much.
                Another potential problem is that read and write workloads are often
                asymmetrical, with very different performance and scale requirements.

                For greater isolation, the read and the write data could be physically
                separated. In that case, the read database can use its own data schema that
                is optimized for queries. For example, it can store a materialized view of
                the data, in order to avoid complex joins or mappings. It might even use a
                different type of data store. If separate read and write databases are
                used, they must be kept in sync. Typically this is accomplished by having
                the write model publish an event whenever it updates the database.

                Materialized View pattern
            </h6>
            <p dir="ltr">
                To support efficient querying, a common solution is to generate, in
                advance, a view that materializes the data in a format suited to the
                required results set. The Materialized View pattern describes generating
                pre populated views of data in environments where the source data isn't in
                a suitable format for querying, where generating a suitable query is
                difficult, or where query performance is poor due to the nature of the data
                or the data store.
            </p>
            <p dir="ltr">
                These materialized views, which only contain data required by a query,
                allow applications to quickly obtain the information they need. In addition
                to joining tables or combining data entities, materialized views can
                include the current values of calculated columns or data items, the results
                of combining values or executing transformations on the data items, and
                values specified as part of the query. A materialized view can even be
                optimized for just a single query.
            </p>
            <p dir="ltr">
                A key point is that a materialized view and the data it contains is
                completely disposable because it can be entirely rebuilt from the source
                data stores. A materialized view is never updated directly by an
                application, and so it's a specialized cache.
            </p>
            <p dir="ltr">
                When the source data for the view changes, the view must be updated to
                include the new information. You can schedule this to happen automatically,
                or when the system detects a change to the original data. In some cases it
                might be necessary to regenerate the view manually. The figure shows an
                example of how the Materialized View pattern might be used.

                The following figure shows an example of using the Materialized View
                pattern to generate a summary of sales. Data in the Order, OrderItem, and
                Customer tables in separate partitions in an Azure storage account are
                combined to generate a view containing the total sales value for each
                product in the Electronics category, along with a count of the number of
                customers who made purchases of each item.

                Event Sourcing pattern
            </h6>
            <p dir="ltr">
                The CQRS pattern is often used along with the Event Sourcing pattern. When
                used with the
                <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/patterns/event-sourcing">
                    Event Sourcing
                </a>
                pattern, the store of events is the write model, and is the official source
                of information. The read model of a CQRS-based system provides materialized
                views of the data, typically as highly denormalized views. These views are
                tailored to the interfaces and display requirements of the application,
                which helps to maximize both display and query performance.
            </p>
            <p dir="ltr">
                Using the stream of events as the write store, rather than the actual data
                at a point in time, avoids update conflicts on a single aggregate and
                maximizes performance and scalability. The events can be used to
                asynchronously generate materialized views of the data that are used to
                populate the read store.
            </p>
            <p dir="ltr">
                Because the event store is the official source of information, it is
                possible to delete the materialized views and replay all past events to
                create a new representation of the current state when the system evolves,
                or when the read model must change. The materialized views are in effect a
                durable read-only cache of the data.
